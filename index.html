    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p> I started learning programming when I as ten but I never took it seriously. Then when the pandemic
        happened and I had an experience which made me re-think my choices. Here I am now changing the world
        through programmin.

    <h3>Sewing</h3>
    <p>I find it funny how growing up I watched my mum sew most of the time but I never really took 
        any interest. I eventually picked interest when I was 12 and now I can say I am a pro or not.

    <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
    <p>I was exteremly shy of speaking infront of people gowing up. When I entered high school all that 
 changed for me because I realised my comfort zone was actually on stage.Now nothing can stop me,
no matter how large the audience is. </p>
